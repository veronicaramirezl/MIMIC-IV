## Introduction <a name='introduction'></a>
MIMIC-IV is a freely available electronic health record (EHR) dataset encompassing a decade of patient information (2008-2019) from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [1]. It surpasses its predecessor, MIMIC-III, with a better structure and additional patient information [2, 3].

The dataset draws upon two primary sources: a comprehensive hospital-wide EHR system and an ICU-specific clinical information system [1]. Rigorous de-identification procedures ensure patient privacy while preserving the data's scientific integrity.

It includes vital signs, diagnoses, medications, procedures, and de-identified clinical notes [1]. Researchers leverage MIMIC-IV to investigate disease progression, train machine learning models, and develop clinical decision support tools [1, 2].

As a result, null dates of death indicate the patient was alive at least up to that time point. Inferences regarding patient death beyond one year cannot be made using MIMIC-IV (as per the PhyioNet website) [2]. The majority of patient death information is acquired from hospital records when the individual dies within the BIDMC or an affiliated institute.

MIMIC-IV also offers a dedicated module: MIMIC-IV ECG. This subset focuses specifically on diagnostic electrocardiograms (ECGs) [2]. It includes approximately 800,000 10-second ECG recordings from nearly 160,000 unique patients. Each ECG utilizes 12 leads and is sampled at 500 Hz [3].
